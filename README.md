To start the viewports, i choose 600 pixels for the mobile viewport as i saw that most modern phones have atleast 600px resolutions, moving to the tablet resolution i chose 601-1024px as most modern tablets can handle this resolution. and finally for the laptop viewport i chose 1024-1366px as most laptops handle atleast 1080 px across. 

moving to the colors i chose to use my linear gradient in the header of every page using from left to right with the hex numbers,# C2B1FA,#D9B1FA,#F3BEFA,#F1B1FA,#FAB1DE,#FAB1B3 to go from a purple to a pink
